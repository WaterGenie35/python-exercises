For any grid of dimension $w$ by $h$,
- there are $w + h$ times in which we must choose between moving right or down
- out of these, we must have $w$ right moves (forcing $h$ down moves and vice versa)
Choosing either way is equivalent, so we can min to simplify:

$\text{choose}(w + h, \text{min}(w, h))$
